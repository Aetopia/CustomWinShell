# Custom Win Shell 🐚
A batch script to customise Windows' CLI [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) without any external software. Currently only Command Prompt is supported and PowerShell is planned to be supported soon. Other shells could be supported in the future? I am not sure, make an issue or pull request if you want to add to the project.

Currently only one preset is avaliable and it looks like this:

More are presets are planned to be released in the future with a better system to manage the presets.
